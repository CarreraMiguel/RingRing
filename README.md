This is my own application trying to emule a simple Social Media but focused on a realistic development eviroment as part of a team.

Main funcionalities on my Social Media: There are Users who are able to create 3 types of Posts (Text, Images or Videos). 
Also comment their own or posts of other Users. Users also can add and remove friends and check with who are they friends or which posts they have created.

On this project i am using different techonologies as:
-Flyway to have control of my BD versions during the process.
-Docker Compose to get up my DB
-Mokito will be used for testing
-PostgreSQL as the BD type
-PostMan to check correct working of my endpoints.
-All app its build over Java17

Hope you guys like it and i would love to remain you that i am open to PR, and comments about my project development and ways to improve it!
Thank you so much.
